By the spring of 2020 most of us were working remotely, whether we wanted to or not! 
Thankfully, we kept all of our office forged friendships alive via endless video calls and remote Friday drinks. It wasn't quite the same, but hey, it was temporary and we'll all be back to normal soon enough. Right... riiiiiggght?

Wroooong! As lockdowns and restrictions went on month after month, our lives seemed to be paused, suspended mid air like astronauts on the [international space station](https://media.giphy.com/media/WQOjbfvfURJW9G1kFp/giphy.gif). 

Even though we might want/need to change jobs, there is now added nervousness to the already difficult interview process. We must leap into the unknown in an even bigger way than before.

**Have no fear, Adelina is here!**

I've recently gone through the process of getting a new remote job and I'm here to help you fight off common fears of getting a new remote job. I'll combat those fears with a mixture of interview questions and actions to take after starting your new role.

## Fear 1: They know each other, I won't fit in!
It's daunting enough learning new technologies and contributing to a new codebase, but now you will be stepping into a well established team that already know each other from the office and be the odd one out.
This is where you'd want to get an idea of how the team go about planning and delivering their work.

### At interview stage
- **How do the team work together in the remote world?** - it's important to get a good idea about what your day to day work on the team might look like - will you be pairing? will be working closely with other people or can you expect to work mostly alone? Make sure that what they are describing will suit you
- **What do you think I could help with?** - this will give you a good idea of where the team might expect you to start contributing and whether this is work you might find interesting. While this answer is subject to change, it will be good to hear how the team envision the project roadmap going forward
- **What is the onboarding process?** - this will show you how the team plan to support you when you join. If there is no formalised onboarding/new joiner process, try to gauge if the team are excited to be welcoming a new joiner
- If not done, **request to chat to some members of your prospective team/group** if an offer is made to you. This will ensure that you can put some names and faces to others you might be working with. You can also use this opportunity to ask more detailed questions of how the team work

### After starting
- If not already done, **request an onboarding buddy/mentor** from your team be assigned and allocated the time/resources to help you get set up. It's important to have a default person that you can reach out when you are getting set up now the team won't be able to tell that you are stuck/feeling frustrated
- Get a **detailed system run through from someone that really understands it**. It's important to get things right from the very start to avoid painful confusion later. Documentation can be out of date, so reaching out to someone will help avoid any inconsistencies/mistakes
- If you plan to learn new technologies/upskill, **get a mentor and make a specific plan of how you can achieve your upskill goals**, alongside onboarding and your regular work. Setting specific goals will ensure that the team understand the efforts you are making beyond the daily deliverables and it sets them up for supporting you

## Fear 2: The work vibe might be awful!
Traditionally, you would have been invited into the office for the full loop interview before receiving an offer. At this point you'd be able to see what the working atmosphere was like and see the perks, coffee machines and what not. 
Without the office visit, it might be hard to get an idea of what working there might be like. 
This is where you'd want to get an idea of how the company go about keeping employees happy and motivated.

### Interview questions
- **What would a typical week/sprint look like for me?** - this interesting question will give you an idea of what the day to day work will be like and whether it suits your requirements. You'd want to find out what the working schedule will be like, how much flexi time they give people and what regular meetings would be part of your schedule
- **What are your long term plans regarding remote work?** - you should make sure that their long term plans will suit you - whether you wish to be permanently remote or not, your prospective employer should be aligned to what you're looking for 
- **What is your Learning&Development(L&D) culture like?** - the L&D culture is a good indicator of how dedicated the company is to investing into the growth of their employees and whether they might be a good fit for you longer term

### After starting
Being new offers you a fresh perspective on the team and company as a whole so make sure that you put this fresh perspective to good use and **be vocal and constructive on how they can improve during retros, 1-1s etc.** In my experience, tech organizations are quite open to change if it is presented in a well argumented way. Don't be scared to suggest improvements just because you are the newest member of the team and get stuck into changing what bothers you. 

## Fear 3: I won't be able to make friends!
Going into the new dawn of remote working, we all had the shared history of working together at the office and countless adventures at lunch and after work. The stakes are high, as we are faced with leaving behind our last real forged relationships.
It's important to make sure that your prospective employer will give you as much or al little socialization as suits you. 

### Interview questions
- **What remote social events have you organized?** - having worked remotely for some time, most teams will have organized social events/catchups, if there was any interest. You can ask about Friday socials and engineering lunches to your heart's content here and see how social the team/company are
- **What clubs/groups/guilds are there are at the company?** - if you are a social butterfly, this will be a very important point to you. If you are more interested in learning and coding dojos (like yours truly), then ask about this too
- **What are some D&I initiatives/practices you have implemented?** - a bit of a hot topic, but I definitely think this should be a question that everyone should ask. No matter who you are, we should all ensure that there is space for everyone on the team

### After starting
- **Take the time to have a catchup with everyone you are working directly with**. This can be a virtual coffee/informal chat or a more formal chat about your background and your career. This will help people get to know you on a more personal level despite the distance
- If you are missing one, **start a new club/group/guild that you are interested in**. If you don't get anyone on board, then you know that there wasn't much interest in it to begin with, but at least you will have tried to make a positive impact and hopefully made some friends at the company in the mean time
- Just as I said before, you should take advantage of your unique outside perspective and **be vocal and constructive** on how the team and company as a whole can improve.

## Parting words
No matter how diligent you are in the interview phase, starting a new job will always be a leap of faith, but I wanted to give you the confidence that you can get good signals of what working there will be like, despite all these remote uncertainties. 

Once you start, you should not shy away from proposing changes despite being "the new one". Ensure that you get the most out of your probation period and use it wisely to ensure your new team/company are a good fit for you.

Stay critical, ask lots of questions and make educated decisions.

**Happy interviewing & job hunting!**
