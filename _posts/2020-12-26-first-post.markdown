Hello everyone! 

This is my first post. Have a seat, let's get to know each other!

## My London experience

I'm Adelina and I've been a Back End engineer for about 6 years now. I've also lived in London for a little over 6 years so most of my tech experience has been in this wonderful city I call home. 

The London tech scene is competitive, but I've really enjoyed working with some extremely talented people. The concentration of tech talent in London is astounding and I count myself really lucky to live and work in this amazing place.

I've worked for a few different sectors - mostly in financial consulting and startups (even though the term is used liberally nowadays, they were technically startups!). You can read more about my experience in my [About me]({% link about_me.md %}) section.


I've always been a Back End engineer, so my Front End knowledge is pretty much non-existent (which explains the basic appearance of this site! Sorry to all the pros out there!). 

I worked with Java until 2018, when I switched jobs and converted to Go. 
The conversion to Go wasn't super easy, but it was definitely manageable and I was able to learn on the job. 
(I read a few books and took some Udemy courses. I will probably tell you more about that in a separate post.)

I was invited to speak at GoLab 19, a Go conference in Florence, in the autumn of 2019. I ran a 3hr and 45min workshop titled <a href="https://talks.godoc.org/github.com/addetz/go_apps_101_slides/golab19.slide#1" target="_blank">Go apps 101 - How to build and test them</a>.
Putting the workshop together was such a Herculean effort that it is something I continue to be proud of achieving only after a year of writing Go.

## What I want to write about

I want to give my perspective on work, life, tech and everything in between. 

I want to share things that I've learned from my victories and most importantly failures (of which there have been a fair few!) throughout my diverse tech career. 

I've learned to work with a large variety of people, colleagues and clients alike, and I can definitely say that communication skills are very important for good engineers. These softer skills will also feature in this blog alongside tech material. 

Most importantly, I hope to remind everyone that we are all people, working in an incredibly complex and fast changing field, doing our best to have a long-lasting career in tech. It's so important to share and learn from each other, so that we can have a sense of community.

**Let the good times roll!**
