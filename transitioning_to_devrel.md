# Transitioning from Engineer to DevRel @ Form3
The following content outlines the key points that I intend to cover in a Q&A session with [Eddie Jaoude](https://twitter.com/eddiejaoude).

## Background
- Senior Java engineer, converted to Go in 2018
- Spoke at [GopherCon Europe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJL7RXAIJzk) and [GopherCon UK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhnL5addsVo) in 2021
- LinkedIn Learning instructor recently with [Applied Concurrency in Go course](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/instructors/adelina-simion)
- My favourite part of being an engineer is working together and learning from other engineers.
- Software engineers have to constantly learn and upskill, if they are to have a lifelong career in tech. Senior engineers need to help mentor their less experienced colleagues through this process.
- I started speaking at conferences as a way to challenge myself and build up my self esteem. This paved the way to me looking into a career in DevRel.

## Overview of DevRel roles
1. As the field of DevRel is quite new, the audience might benefit from a quick introduction to the different broad categories of roles.
1. DevRel sits at the intersection of product, engineering, marketing and sales.
1. In general, DevRel roles are split between:
    - Community builders foster and take care of developer & user communities
    - Developer advocates educate and advocate for the needs of their users inside the company.
    - Tech evangelists or ambassadors represent the company for the purpose of spreading the word about their brand to users/professionals.
1. The roles and responsibilities of each role vary according to the needs of their employer.
    - Two fantastic resources that explain all things DevRel are [Sam Julien's excellent blog & books](https://www.samjulien.com/) and [Mary Thengvall's excellent DevRel book](https://www.marythengvall.com/devrelbook).
1. [Form3](https://www.form3.tech/) are a B2B payment technology provider. Their cloud native platform is written in Go.
    - As they don't have a publicly available product, the community building aspects take a backseat in their DevRel needs.
    - They have opted for a Tech Evangelist, who can support them in sharing their technical stories and engineering culture, as their first DevRel role.

## My tips for interviewing for a DevRel role
1. You DON'T need to have a massive social media following to get your first DevRel role, but you DO need to have a Twitter, GitHub and LinkedIn profiles with some relevant posts on them.
    - As part of their initial screening, the Talent team will look up your social media profile to see how you engage with the Tech community.
    - Eddie often explains on Twitter how to engage with others in a constructive and friendly way on Twitter.
1. You DON'T need to have a huge portfolio of talks, but you DO need to have some current examples of material you could produce.
    - Start a blog or write on [dev.to](https://dev.to/) or [Medium](https://medium.com/) to produce some writing samples. Personally, I prefer dev.to between the two as the text editing is nicer.
    - If you do manage to speak at a conference, then you can use this as a video sample content. Otherwise, try to record a short tutorial or similar and upload to Youtube.
    - I made my own blog using Jekyll and Github Pages, but if I were to start over I'd probably opt for dev.to. In my experience in interview process, everyone looked at my blog and read some writing samples, including our CTO, when I got to the final round.
1. DON'T underestimate the power of the cover letter.
    - Engineers are not used to writing cover letters, but I think they are a great opportunity to showcase your writing skills when applying for a DevRel role.
    - I wrote a 1 page cover letter, where I explained why I wanted to be considered for the role. This gave me the option to explain my resume a bit more and offered some background about why I was interested in working at Form3. Again, everyone read it throughout the interview process.
1. DO research the company you are applying to more than you might do for an engineering role.
    - Most DevRel roles, including the ones where you will be joining an established DevRel team, require you to be a self starter with ideas.
    - Make sure you research the company you are applying to and come up with some concrete ideas of how you can contribute to their program.
    - I made some boards with screenshots from the company website where I jotted some ideas. In the end, I ended up sharing my boards during the interview. As I was quite nervous, my preparation helped me anchor myself and present my ideas.

## Life as a Tech Evangelist @ Form3
1. As mentioned previously, I was the first DevRel hire at Form3. My role is all about telling our engineering stories to the tech community and making others aware of the Form3 brand and the work we do.
1. I work very closely with the engineering and marketing departments.
    - I have weekly 1-1s with our CMO, CTO and our head of engineering. So, even though I'm a team of one, I receive support from the heads of departments on a regular basis. I use these 1-1s to run them through any of my ideas, issues that I run into and questions that I might have.
    - There are quite a few engineers at Form3, who are keen to be speakers and get involved with DevRel initiatives. I work and discuss ideas with them as well, and plan to co-speak with them in the future.
1. DevRel work is cyclical and varies quite a lot throughout the year. This makes it an exciting, but at times stressful field.
    - Conference season happens in May-June and in September-October. This means that we have to respond to CFPs, then prep our talks cyclically throughout the year.
    - I've pitched to a few conferences at the end of last year and the beginning of this year, and have been using my time to produce more written content and organise our tech podcast.
    - Due to Covid, a lot of meetups have been cancelled, but I am finding a few good online only conferences or events. We are big fans of [Conf42](https://www.conf42.com/), who run free events, hosted on Youtube.
1. Overall, I find that my role involves balancing multiple priorities at the same time:
    - Producing content at a regular cadence to share on social media
    - Posting content on Twitter and engaging with the tech community online
    - Responding to CFPs to make sure that we have a stream of upcoming speaking opportunities. The Twitter account [TechDailyCFP](https://twitter.com/TechDailyCFP) has been a lifesaver for this. Highly recommend!
    - Preparing talks and other tech content for events that we are speaking at
    - Working together with Marketing and Talent departments to get ready for events we are sponsoring, as well as identifying events which are a good fit for us to sponsor and making those suggestions to the heads of department 

## Conclusions
All in all, I'm really grateful that Form3 have given me the opportunity to transition to a DevRel role. I've learned a lot and I'm really enjoying exploring DevRel through my work.

The last bit of advice I'd like to leave the audience with is that they shouldn't forget about their personal brand, once they do transition to their first DevRel role. Make sure that you take the time to maintain and build out your talks and blog content, regardless of how busy you might be at work.
