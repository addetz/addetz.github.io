Hi! I'm Adelina, currently living in London and working as a Senior Software Engineer at [Cytora](https://cytora.com/).

This is my blog/space - there are many like it, but this one is mine!

I will post about: 

- Neat stuff I learn about [Go](https://golang.org/) 
- Working in Tech in London 
- Being a woman in Tech 
- My general thoughts and musings

This page is WIP.
